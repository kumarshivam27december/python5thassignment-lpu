# operator precedence
# multilicatin has higher precedence over substraction 
# print(10-4*2)
# paranthesis ( has higher precedence over multiplication)
# print((10-4)*2)
# Associativity (left to right in python)

# when two operators have same precedence then it helps us to determine the order of the operations. 
# almost all the operators have left to right respectively


# print(5**2//3)

# print(5//2*3)
# exponent operator has right to left associatevely
# print(2**3**4)
